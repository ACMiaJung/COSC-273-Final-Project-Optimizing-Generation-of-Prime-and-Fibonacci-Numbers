# COSC 273 Final Project: Optimizing the Generation of Prime and Fibonacci Numbers

This final project focuses on generating prime and Fibonacci numbers, with an aim to optimize their computation using parallel and distributed programming techniques like multithreading and SIMD vector operations.

We will start with the baseline implementations of generating these mathematically significant numbers and take it one step further by attempting to compute them as efficiently and optimally as possible.
